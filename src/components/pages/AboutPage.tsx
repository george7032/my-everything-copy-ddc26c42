            Embakasi Benedicta Academy grew out of a simple conviction: that children learn best when
            they are taught well, known personally and encouraged daily. From the beginning the school
            has focused on strong classroom teaching, close contact with parents and a safe, orderly
            environment.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            Today the Academy serves families across Utawala and the surrounding area, offering
            learning from Kindergarten through Primary and Junior School to Senior School, supported
            by facilities that include classrooms, a library, green outdoor spaces and a distinctive
            on-site kids amusement park.
